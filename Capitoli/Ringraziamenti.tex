I thank my thesis advisor, Professor Lucas Omar MÃ¼ller, for his patience, guidance and support. I have benefited greatly from his knowledge and advice, without which this thesis would not have been possible.\\

Due thanks also go to Dr. Christian Contarino, who was not only crucial in choosing and developing the topic, but also gave me constant moral support.
